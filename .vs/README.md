# Open Traveling Metal first, because it's the index file (main page of the website, in it there are 3 new trains with a short information about them, if you want to see more info you can press on the buttons "MORE INFORMATION" or on the navbar you can click on "Train description") 
# The style_trains.css is the CSS part, decoration of the website(color, background-color, etc.)
# There are other pages like Contacts(if you want to contact the developer), Train description and More trains (which show you different trains)
